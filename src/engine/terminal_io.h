// Contract-side types for the SPK_TERMINAL control/test channel (docs/dev/terminal-*.md).
// These live on the engine side of the boundary (not in src/terminal/) so IEngine can declare
// handle_command() without the contract depending on the terminal service. The concrete Terminal
// implements ITextOut; the dispatcher wraps it in a TextSink and hands engines a read-only
// CommandView over the already-tokenized argv - so an engine never touches the codec or the USB path.
//
// Everything here is compiled only under SPK_TERMINAL; when the flag is off the header is inert and
// the IEngine hooks that reference these types do not exist (zero cost when off).
